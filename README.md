# BPMN-and-Petri-Net-Modeling-Case-P53-Pesca

University project developed for the Business Process Modeling course.
The work focuses on the “Pesca” (P53) case study, modeled and analyzed using BPMN and Petri Nets.
The project includes process modeling, conversion to Petri Nets, and formal analysis of soundness and correctness using WoPeD.

Project Structure
- DICANDIA 657494 BPMproject p53 pesca.pdf — Full report in Italian.
- DICANDIA 657494 BPMproject p53 pesca ENG.pdf — Full report in English.
- File .bpmn — BPMN process diagrams (main and variant) created with Bizagi Modeler.
- File .pnml WoPeD — Petri Net models generated with WoPeD for formal validation.

Tools Used
- Bizagi Modeler → for BPMN diagram creation and variant modeling
- WoPeD (Workflow Petri Net Designer) → for Petri Net transformation and analysis

Learning Objectives
- Understand and apply BPMN notation for process modeling.
- Transform BPMN diagrams into Petri Nets for formal validation.
- Analyze process soundness, boundedness, and reachability.
